abstract="A universal Gr{\"o}bner basis is a finite basis for a polynomial ideal that has the Gr{\"o}bner property with respect to all admissible term-orders. Let R be a commutative polynomial ring over a field K, or more generally a non-commutative polynomial ring of solvable type over K (see [KRW]). We show, how to construct and characterize left, right, two-sided, and reduced universal Gr{\"o}bner bases in R. Moreover, we extend the upper complexity bounds in [We4] to the construction of universal Gr{\"o}bner bases. Finally, we prove the stability of universal Gr{\"o}bner bases under specialization of coefficients. All these results have counterparts for polynomial rings over commutative regular rings (comp. [We3]).",

abstract = "To every ideal I in the polynomial ring A:=k[X1,…, Xn] new invariants are attached, such as the Gröbner Fan F(I), the Gröbner region G(I) and the set ATO(I) of the almost term-orderings of I, i.e. orderings which “behave like” term-orderings with respect to I. These invariants arise by considering the reduced Gröbner bases of I with respect to all the term-orderings. Moreover F(I), G(I), ATO(I) can be got in a constructive way, as we show by producing a suitable algorithm which computes them."
