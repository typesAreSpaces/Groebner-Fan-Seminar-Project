abstract = "To every ideal I in the polynomial ring A:=k[X1,…, Xn] new invariants are attached, such as the Gröbner Fan F(I), the Gröbner region G(I) and the set ATO(I) of the almost term-orderings of I, i.e. orderings which “behave like” term-orderings with respect to I. These invariants arise by considering the reduced Gröbner bases of I with respect to all the term-orderings. Moreover F(I), G(I), ATO(I) can be got in a constructive way, as we show by producing a suitable algorithm which computes them."

This bound is achieved by a simple procedure for the semigroup problem."
