\section{Conclusions}

In this technical report we discussed the geometric structure
of the \grob fan, the motivation for this research topic, and
an algorithm for computing the latter. In few words, the \grob fan of an ideal is the
collection of the cones associated with each of the reduced
marked \grob basis for all possible monomial orders. With this
project I had the opportunity to learn about the connections between
\grob bases and other branches of mathematics, its importance, and several
tools that are useful for this discipline.

For future work I would like come up with heuristic to enhance performance
of the current algorithms available. As a first step, I consider important
to study a recent technique that exploits some symmetries in the
geometric structure of the \grob fan \cite{2007MaCom..76.2189F}.

I also learned many intricate details about the Mora and Robbiano algorithm
by implementing their algorithm and doing examples. The latter helped me
to consolidate and fix a wrong picture I used to have about the
method.
